        description: `My fitness journey began early, driven by my father’s influence and a passion for
working out. In 2013, I committed to a healthier lifestyle, losing 40 pounds in 18
months. Down the road I realized the importance of balancing physical fitness with
mental well-being. Unhealthy habits and unstable emotional health led to burnout
and eventually contributed to a herniated disc injury. A two-year recovery period
tested my determination, but in 2023, I began my comeback, and now, in 2024, I’m
thriving once again. Through my personal experience with burnout, injury, and
recovery, I’m passionate about helping others achieve their goals and overcome
obstacles on their own fitness journeys.`
